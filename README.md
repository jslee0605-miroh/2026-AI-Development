    - [Let's Be Honest: Generative AI Isn't](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/lets-be-honest-generative-ai-isnt) - Perspective on what generative AI can and cannot do reliably.
  

### Lecture 2 (Costs and Processing)
- **Topic**: Vertical Slices, MVPs, Crawling, Walking, and Running
- **Slides**: `lecture_2/slides/lecture_2.pdf`
- **Notebook**: `lecture_2/notebooks/resume_screening.ipynb`
- **Data**: `lecture_2/data/resumes_final.csv` (130 resumes for AI-assisted scoring)

- **Readings for lecture 3**:
  - **Vertical vs. Horizontal Slices**
    - [Comparing Approaches: Horizontal Slice vs Vertical Slice Programming](https://victormagalhaes-dev.medium.com/comparing-approaches-horizontal-slice-vs-vertical-slice-programming-d8db017952e4) - Understanding different development approaches.

  - **Right-Sized Unit of Work**
    - [AI Unit of Work](https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2025/09/15/ai-unit-of-work/) - How to scope work appropriately for AI systems.

  - **AI Limitations and Best Practices**
    - [AI Blindspots](https://ezyang.github.io/ai-blindspots/) - Understanding where AI agents fail and how to design around it.
    - [Scaling Agents](https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents) - Cursor's insights on building production-grade AI agents.

### Lecture 3 (Improving Performance)
- **Topic**: Context Engineering Techniques for Better Results
- **Slides**: `lecture_3/slides/lecture_3.pdf`
- **Notebook**: `lecture_3/notebooks/lecture_3_resume_scorer_improvement.ipynb`
- **Data**: `lecture_3/data/resumes_final.csv` (130 resumes), `lecture_3/data/job_req_senior.md`
- **Key Techniques**: Decomposition, Grounding with Citations, Few-Shot Examples
- **Teaching Example**: Expense report validator (slides only)
- **Hands-on**: Apply techniques to improve the resume scorer from Lecture 2

## Under Construction below!

### Lecture 4 (tools/MCP-like + orchestrator)
- **Problem**: Research brief generation using a tool registry and a simple orchestrator loop
- **Notebook**: `lecture_4/notebooks/lecture_4_tooling_orchestrator.ipynb`
- **Data/docs**: `lecture_4/data/` (docs + market signals + tool registry)

## Running notebooks (per lecture)

Each lecture directory contains a `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, and `pyproject.toml`.

From a lecture directory (e.g. `lecture_2/`):
- `make build`
- `make notebook` (starts Jupyter in Docker on port 8888)
- `make interactive` (drops you into a bash shell in the container)

## Building slides

Slides are in Beamer (LaTeX) under each lecture’s `slides/` folder.

Example:
```bash
cd lecture_1/slides
pdflatex lecture_1.tex
```

## Improvements for next time
