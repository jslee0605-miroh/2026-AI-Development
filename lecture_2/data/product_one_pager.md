# Product one-pager (fictional)

## Product: SignalSpring
SignalSpring is a workflow toolkit that helps teams build reliable LLM-powered pipelines in Python.

## What it does
- Connects to LLM APIs (including OpenRouter) from Python
- Supports structured outputs (JSON) with schema validation
- Adds logging for prompts/outputs and basic evaluation utilities
- Enables human review steps (approve/edit/reject) inside workflows

## What it does NOT do
- It is not a CRM
- It does not guarantee business outcomes
- It does not provide medical, legal, or financial advice

## Security & data handling
- In this workshop, we will only use synthetic/sample data
- Do not paste secrets (API keys, passwords) into prompts

## Typical use cases
- Drafting outreach with compliance checks
- Support ticket triage and response drafting
- Document-grounded Q&A with citations
