# Brand guidelines (fictional)

## Voice
- Clear, friendly, concise
- Confident but not salesy
- Avoid hype words (e.g., "revolutionary", "guaranteed", "magic")

## Do
- Use the recipient's role/company context if available
- Ask 1–2 specific questions
- Offer a low-friction next step (15-minute chat, share a one-pager)

## Don't
- Make unverifiable claims about the recipient or their company
- Claim outcomes (e.g., "you will save 30%") unless provided in approved facts
- Use medical/legal/financial advice language

## Format constraints
- Subject line: 4–8 words, no emojis
- Email body: 90–140 words
- Include a short sign-off
