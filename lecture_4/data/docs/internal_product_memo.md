# Internal memo: Q4 positioning (fictional)

## Summary
SignalSpring is positioned as a workflow toolkit for building reliable LLM-powered pipelines in Python.

## Target users
- Data/ML engineers prototyping LLM workflows
- Product teams integrating LLM features with guardrails

## Differentiators (allowed claims)
- Structured outputs (JSON) + validation patterns
- Logging and evaluation utilities for iteration
- Human review steps can be integrated into workflows

## Caveats
- Not a CRM, not a full agent platform
- No guaranteed outcomes; avoid claims like \"save 30%\" unless proven and provided
