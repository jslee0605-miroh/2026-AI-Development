# Billing FAQ (SignalSpring)

## Duplicate charges
If you believe you were charged twice:
1. Confirm invoice IDs and the last 4 digits of the card on file.
2. If it is a duplicate charge, we can issue a refund for the duplicate invoice.
3. Refunds typically post within 5–10 business days.

## What we need from you
- Invoice ID(s)
- Amount(s)
- Confirmation that the invoice is duplicated (same period / same plan)
