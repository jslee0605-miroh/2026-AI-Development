# Security & data handling (SignalSpring)

## Prompt and output logging
SignalSpring includes optional logging to help teams debug and evaluate workflows.

Workshop guidance:
- Use only sample/synthetic data
- Do not paste secrets into prompts
- If your organization requires it, disable logging for production workflows

## DPAs and enterprise requirements
Enterprise customers may request:
- A DPA (Data Processing Addendum)
- Data retention information
- Controls around telemetry and logging
