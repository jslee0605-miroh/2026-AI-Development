## Systems and system thinking

- How do we abstract and organize our code
- How do we break it down into inputs and outputs that make sense
- How do we break these down into functions

Before coding we want to break down the required tasks and _then_ start coding

## Methodology & Design

## Vertical Slices

- AI systems are complex and rather than boiling the ocean we will concentrate on building vertical slices of systems and then expanding horizontally. 
- We will build the entire flow that works _in the simplest, single case_ and then introduce additional complexity

## Crawl, Walk, Run

Questions is the MVP the crawl or the run?

- Crawl: What is the minimum code that we can write to verify that it is possible in some instances. 
- Walk: What is the minimum amount of code that we can write to verify that 
- Run: What does the full system look like
